<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started creating all of the HTML elements so I would have a good starting point. I moved onto the CSS, where I began by styling by card, with the appropiate properties. Furthermore, this allowed me to contiune working, and styling the text, and getting the layout right. Next, I styled the footer text, and pushed it to the bottom of the page. Lastly, I tested the website on the following browswers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge. This ensure compatibility that the design would work across different browswers. </p>
