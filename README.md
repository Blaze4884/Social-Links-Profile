<li> I've improved my ability to deal with small bugs and frustrating issues that come my way while programming </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. I moved onto the CSS, and started by adding the background color to body. Next, I started to design the card, and spent some time experimenting with small details until I go the look I liked. I then moved to styling elements like text, images, and finally the social divs. Furthermore, I spent a lot of time trying to solve issues with the design of the social elements, spacing, and other visual bugs. After writing things out, and taking some time think, I came back and solved my issues. Overall, this project helped me improve my problem solving skills, and allowed me to further improve my vanilla CSS skills. </p>
